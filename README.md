What sick rediqulous puppets we are. What a gross little stage we dance on. Dancing screwing around. We are no what was intended. On the subway today a man came up to me to make a conversation. He made a small talk. Lonley man talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accomodating but my head started to hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it did happen but I suddenly threw up all over. He was not pleased and I couldn't stop laughing.
